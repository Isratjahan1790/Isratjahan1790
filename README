## 👋 Hi there, I'm Israt. Passionate about SQA field
🔭 I’m currently working on Govt. project<br>🌱 I’ve learned SQA & Cyber security from IT Training BD<br>👯 I’m still looking to collaborate on SQA field<br>👨‍💻 All of my projects are available at https://github.com/Isratjahan1790<br>📫 Reach me Email: isratjahan2997@gmail.com<br>📄 Know about my specialities please enter https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xOgoLR52QvQ98IjB4sL0LCkPAk7U4bjR/view?usp=share_link<br>⚡ I think, QA is absolutely essential; without it, not only do organizations risk releasing products that are below market standards, but also lose money, wasted time and not fully exploit the potential of an idea.
